== SetupHelper ==

'''SetupHelper''' is Windows shared library intended for use in InnoSetup or other setup packages.
It contains helper functions including functions for automatic/manual closing of IE prior to the installation and wiping of IE virtualized registry key.
The library is to be included in the setup package so that it is not installed with the main application but rather only extracted and used during the setup.
In InnoSetup, for example, one can include the library in the [Files] section:
 <nowiki>[Files]
 Source: "setuphelper.dll"; Flags: dontcopy
And then in the [Code] section include the file containing function definitions:
 <nowiki>[Code]
 #include "setuphelper\helpercode.isi"
